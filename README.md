# Complexity-Crew-AAD-Project
AAD Project Submission for the team Complexity Crew

To run :

-> In the file for each algorithm, there is an .ipynb file.
-> Run each code block of the .ipynb file. This will automatically download any dependencies, compile the code, and run the implementation and comparison against various datasets for each algorithm. It will also generate the required dataset on which to run the algorithm for triangulation as well as the function for visualization of the triangulation.
